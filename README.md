SELF-REFLECTION:
I'm really happy with how well I was able to do this assignment! I was even able to incorporate some minor page responsiveness. The process was surprisingly straightforward. This task, which seemed daunting at first, turned out to be rather quick and easy. I believe the strategy of tackling the page's design one layer at a time, as well as laying out all of the divs and classes right from the get-go, helped keep the project from becoming overwhelming.
